/**
 * Holds the app behind the index.html boot splash until the data the *first screen*
 * needs has resolved, so the UI appears in one shot instead of filling in piecemeal.
 * The bar is determinate: the mounted app plus each settled critical query are real
 * milestones that each fill an equal slice. Every query shares its key with the
 * page/sidebar, so those read straight from cache and never refetch.
 *
 * Which queries are critical depends on the landed route. The home route redirects to the first
 * agent's console, and a reload on /sessions/<id> or /agents/<id> lands in AgentView directly:
 * either way, resolve the runner (session detail, or the agents list), then warm the runner-scoped
 * active-session list AgentView reads on open — otherwise the splash dismisses too early and the
 * console flashes a spinner / "Starting…" while that lands.
 *
 * Only the authenticated app pre-warms. A signed-out visitor on a real route instead
 * waits on a single check — setup-status — so a fresh, zero-user deployment can be routed
 * to first-run /setup before any page renders. The bypass routes (login/enroll/setup)
 * pass straight through. The decision is latched on mount, so the 4s/15s background
 * refetches and later in-app navigations never bring the splash back.
