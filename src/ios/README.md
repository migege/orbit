# Orbit — iOS client

A native SwiftUI client for iPhone + iPad. It is a **remote console**: view and drive sessions,
answer approvals, manage tasks/agents/skills/runners over the same REST + SSE API as the web and
macOS clients. The iOS sandbox forbids controlling a local runner (no process/launchd access), so —
unlike macOS — there is no local-runner surface here. You still need a Mac/Linux runner elsewhere.

## Structure (why this looks the way it does)

The app reuses the macOS shell's shared SwiftUI in place — **Structure B**. There is no copy of the
views: this target compiles the same `.swift` files out of `../macos/OrbitApp/Sources/OrbitApp`,
minus the macOS-only ones, plus the iOS-only files in `Sources/`.

```
src/ios/
  project.yml                 # XcodeGen spec — the checked-in source of truth for the .xcodeproj
  Sources/OrbitiOSApp.swift   # iOS @main entry (no menu-bar/Settings/Window scenes, no Sparkle)
  Support/Info.plist          # bundle keys, orbit:// URL scheme, orientations
  Support/Orbit.entitlements  # empty for now; APNs keys land in Phase E
  Support/Assets.xcassets     # AppIcon (placeholder, reuses the macOS mark) + AccentColor
  .github/workflows/client.yml       # (repo root) generate + build on CI (macOS + iOS)

../macos/OrbitKit             # shared cross-platform core (models, SSE, transcript reducer) — SPM dep
../macos/OrbitApp/Sources     # shared SwiftUI views + @Observable models, referenced in place
```

Cross-platform seams live in `../macos/OrbitApp/Sources/OrbitApp/Platform.swift`
(`PlatformImage`, `PlatformPasteboard`, `Color(light:dark:)`, `borderlessMenuStyle()`); the few
macOS-only touch-points in shared files are behind `#if os(macOS)`.

### Files excluded from the iOS target
Kept in sync in `project.yml`'s `excludes:` — `OrbitApp.swift` (macOS app entry), `HotKeyManager`,
`UpdaterModel` (Sparkle), `RunnerControl` + `RunnerControlPane` (launchctl), `MenuBarContent`.

## Build (requires a Mac — iOS apps can't build on Linux)

```sh
brew install xcodegen          # once
cd src/ios
xcodegen generate              # regenerate Orbit.xcodeproj after any project.yml / file change
open Orbit.xcodeproj           # ⌘R to run on a simulator
# or headless:
xcodebuild -project Orbit.xcodeproj -target Orbit -sdk iphonesimulator \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

`Orbit.xcodeproj` is generated and git-ignored — edit `project.yml`, not the project. On Linux only
OrbitKit (`cd ../macos/OrbitKit && swift test`) is verifiable; the SwiftUI layer compiles on the Mac
CI job.

## Release (TestFlight)

Signed builds go to TestFlight via the `testflight` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` (shared
with the macOS DMG job), using an App Store Connect API key for both signing
(`-allowProvisioningUpdates` creates the cert + profile on the runner) and upload
(`ExportOptions.plist`'s `destination = upload`). No manual certificates, no fastlane.

**One-time setup**
1. In App Store Connect, create the app with bundle id **`io.orbitd.app`** (the same id in `project.yml`).
2. Generate an API key: *Users and Access → Integrations → App Store Connect API → +*, role **Admin**. (App Manager can't create the App Store *distribution* certificate cloud signing needs — you'll hit `exportArchive Cloud signing permission error`; only Admin / Account Holder have Certificates access.) Download the `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8` (one-time download).
3. Add repo secrets (*Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*):
   - `ASC_KEY_ID` — the key's Key ID
   - `ASC_ISSUER_ID` — the Issuer ID above the key list
   - `ASC_KEY_P8_BASE64` — `base64 -i AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8` output
   - `APPLE_TEAM_ID` — already present (shared with the macOS release)

**Cut a build**
```sh
.claude/skills/release/release.sh 0.1.2   # pushes v0.1.2 → macOS DMG + iOS TestFlight
```
iOS and macOS **share one `v*` tag** and one workflow (`release.yml`): pushing `vX.Y.Z` runs both its
`dmg` and `testflight` jobs. The tag sets the marketing version — any `-beta.N` suffix is stripped
for iOS (`v0.1.2-beta.3` → TestFlight `0.1.2`, since `CFBundleShortVersionString` must be numeric);
the build number is the commit count. To build iOS **only**, skip the tag and dispatch with the
platform input: `gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f platform=ios` (builds `0.1.0`).

**Local fallback** (first build, or if CI signing needs debugging): `xcodegen generate` then open
`Orbit.xcodeproj` in Xcode → *Product ▸ Archive* → *Distribute App ▸ TestFlight & App Store*. Xcode
signs with your logged-in Apple ID.

## Roadmap

- **B** — Xcode project stands up, shared sources wired, cross-platform shims. ✔
- **C** — adaptive navigation: iPhone tab shell + iPad three-column. ✔
- **D** — iOS-native polish: attachments (PhotosPicker/`.fileImporter`), pull-to-refresh, keyboard. ✔
- **F** — signing + App Store Connect + TestFlight release workflow; full-bleed app icon. ✔ (this)
- **E** — APNs push (device-token registration + server push for "needs your reply") + icon badge.
- Optional — image paste (⌘V / PasteButton); on-device interaction pass.
