/// Kept in OrbitKit (not the SwiftUI view) so the exact web mapping is shared by macOS + iOS and
/// unit-tested. The view turns `shape`/`tone` into an SF Symbol (or spinner) and a colour.

/// Note vs. web: web also branches on `deletedAt` (a Trash-only glyph) and `archivedAt`, but the
/// session *list* payload sends neither — web derives "completed" from the active tab, and there is
/// no Trash tab on the clients — so those branches don't apply here. `completed` carries the
/// Completed (archived) tab, where a filed session reads as done even though its status settled to
/// CANCELLED; a genuine FAILED still surfaces its real glyph.
