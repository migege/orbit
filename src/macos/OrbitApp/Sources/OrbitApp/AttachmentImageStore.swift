/// carry the JWT), so the bytes are pulled once and the decoded `NSImage` is reused across re-renders
/// and session switches. Lives on `ConsoleRegistry` (one per instance) and is injected into the
/// transcript via SwiftUI environment.

/// The just-sent image is `seed`ed from the bytes already in hand at upload time, so the optimistic
/// bubble shows it instantly (no fetch round-trip) — mirroring the web composer's local preview.
