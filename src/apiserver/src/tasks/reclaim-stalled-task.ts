 * with nothing actually running — the list shows a perpetual running indicator.
 * Task.status is an agent-owned label (see TasksService.withRunning), so we only
 * nudge it back: if NO other session for the task is still occupying it, move
 * IN_PROGRESS -> `resetTo` so the abandoned work surfaces. `resetTo` is OPEN for a
 * retryable end (user cancel / runner offline) — back to the actionable pool — or
 * FAILED for a genuine run failure that needs a human. No-op when another session is
 * still live or the task isn't IN_PROGRESS.
 *
 * Call inside the SAME transaction that finalized the session, AFTER the session's
 * status has been flipped to terminal — so the just-ended session is no longer
 * counted as occupying.
