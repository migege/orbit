# Orbit — Native macOS Client Design

> Status: **proposal**. Scope chosen: a **unified** native app = end-user **console** +
> local-**runner control**, built in **native SwiftUI** (not Tauri/Electron). This document
> is the design record; it maps the existing REST/SSE protocol onto a native client and
> calls out the hard parts, the phasing, and the honest costs.

---

## 0. One-paragraph summary

A single signed-and-notarized macOS app with two surfaces fused into one: a **Console**
(chat with agents, drive tasks, approve tool calls — a native re-implementation of the web
`AgentView`) and **Runner Control** (manage the `launchd` runner *on this same Mac* —
status, quota, logs, enrollment). The app talks to the control plane over the **exact same
REST + SSE protocol the web UI uses** (no server changes needed for the console). The
unifying bet: the app runs on the user's Mac, which is *also* (optionally) a runner host —
so it can do what a browser tab fundamentally cannot: drive `launchctl`, read `~/.orbit`,
post **actionable native notifications** for approvals, and live in the **menu bar**. The
hardest engineering is isolated into a UI-free core package (`OrbitKit`): a hand-rolled
**SSE client** and a **transcript reducer** that mirrors the web's streaming/approval/seq
logic. Distribution is **Developer ID + notarization (not the Mac App Store)**, because
managing `launchd` and reading `~/.orbit` is incompatible with the MAS sandbox.

---

## 1. Why native is defensible here (and where it hurts)

The runner-control half *wants* native: directly bootstrapping `com.orbit.runner` via
`launchctl`, tailing `runner.log`, reading `~/.orbit/config.json`, and posting OS
notifications are all clumsy or impossible from a WebView. That justifies the Swift choice
for **that** surface.

The console half is the cost: the web `AgentView` is ~2,500 lines of hard-won streaming /
approval / worktree behavior plus ~4,500 lines of CSS. Rebuilding it natively is months of
work and creates a **second UI to keep at parity with the web forever**. The mitigation,
baked into this design: push *all* protocol logic into `OrbitKit` so only the **views** are
duplicated, and let long-tail surfaces (Skills browser, Admin, Settings detail) **deep-link
into the web** rather than be rebuilt. See §10 (Risks).

---

## 2. What the client talks to (protocol recap)

Everything below already exists and is used by the web UI — the console needs **zero**
server changes.

- **Base:** `https://<instance>/api`, JWT Bearer, 7-day token, no refresh endpoint
  (re-login on 401). One origin (gateway), `/api/*` proxied to the control plane.
- **Auth:** `POST /auth/login {email,password} → {accessToken,user}`;
  `GET /auth/setup-status → {needsSetup}`; `POST /auth/bootstrap`; `POST /auth/change-password`.
- **Real-time:** **SSE only** — `GET /sessions/:id/events?sinceSeq=N`. No WebSocket (gateway
  strips `Upgrade`). Browser EventSource needs `?access_token=`; **native `URLSession` should
  use the `Authorization` header instead** (cleaner, keeps the token out of URLs/logs).
- **Sessions:** `POST /sessions` (create+first prompt), `GET /sessions?view=active|archived|deleted`,
  `GET /sessions/:id`, `POST /sessions/:id/turns`, `DELETE /sessions/:id/turns/:turnId`
  (withdraw queued), `POST .../resume|interrupt|end|archive|restore`, `DELETE /sessions/:id`,
  `PATCH /sessions/:id/config` (model/permission/effort mid-session),
  `GET/POST /sessions/:id/diff[/refresh]`, `POST /sessions/:id/merge|commit`.
- **Approvals:** `GET /sessions/:id/approvals?status=PENDING`,
  `POST /sessions/:id/approvals/:approvalId/decision {behavior, message?, answers?, rememberRule?}`.
- **Tasks:** `GET/POST /tasks`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /tasks/:id`, `POST /tasks/:id/execute`,
  `POST /tasks/batch-execute|batch-stop|batch-assign`, comments, dependencies.
- **Agents:** `GET/POST /agents`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /agents/:id`, `POST /agents/reorder`.
- **Runners:** `GET /runners`, enrollment tokens, device approve
  (`POST /runners/device/:userCode/approve`), `PATCH /runners/:id`, rotate-token, delete.
- **Attachments:** `POST /attachments?sessionId=…` (multipart, ≤25 MB) → `{id}`; reference
  the id in the turn payload. `GET /attachments/:id` to display.
- **Me/prefs:** `GET /users/me`, `PATCH /users/me/preferences {theme,defaultModel,…}`.

Turn-send rule (important for the composer): `/turns` is **rejected 409 while RUNNING**,
accepted in `AWAITING_INPUT`; a per-run pending cap returns **429**; `clientTurnId` (client
UUID) is the idempotency key. Queue-while-running is allowed via the durable PENDING turn —
the composer queues optimistically and reconciles on the server `user` event.

---

## 3. App architecture

Two layers. The core is deliberately UI-free so it can be unit-tested and is the only place
protocol logic lives.

```

State: SwiftUI `@Observable` (Observation framework) stores in `OrbitKit`; views observe.
No external state lib. `URLSession` (one shared, plus per-stream tasks). Concurrency via
Swift structured concurrency (`async`/`await`, `AsyncSequence`, `Task`).

---

## 4. The two hard problems

### 4.1 SSE client (`EventStream`)

`URLSession` has no `EventSource`. Roll a small one over the bytes async-sequence — no third-
party dependency needed:

```swift
// Sketch — the core loop.
func stream(sessionID: String, sinceSeq: Int) -> AsyncThrowingStream<RunEvent, Error> {
    AsyncThrowingStream { continuation in
        let task = Task {
            var url = api.url("/sessions/\(sessionID)/events")
            url.append(queryItems: [.init(name: "sinceSeq", value: String(sinceSeq))])
            var req = URLRequest(url: url)
            req.setValue("Bearer \(token)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")  // native: header, not ?access_token
            req.setValue("text/event-stream", forHTTPHeaderField: "Accept")
            req.timeoutInterval = 3600
            let (bytes, resp) = try await session.bytes(for: req)
            guard (resp as? HTTPURLResponse)?.statusCode == 200 else { /* map 401→reauth */ }
            var dataLines: [String] = []
            for try await line in bytes.lines {          // SSE framing: data:… lines, blank = dispatch
                if line.hasPrefix("data:") { dataLines.append(String(line.dropFirst(5)).trimmingPrefix(" ")) }
                else if line.isEmpty, !dataLines.isEmpty {
                    let json = dataLines.joined(separator: "\n"); dataLines.removeAll()
                    if let ev = try? decoder.decode(RunEvent.self, from: Data(json.utf8)) {
                        continuation.yield(ev)
                    }
                }
            }
            continuation.finish()
        }
        continuation.onTermination = { _ in task.cancel() }
    }
}
```

Robustness rules (get these wrong and transcripts corrupt):
- **Reconnect with the high-water seq.** Track `maxSeq` seen; on drop, reopen with
  `?sinceSeq=maxSeq`. Server replays persisted `RunEvent`s with `seq > sinceSeq`, then goes
  live. **Dedup by seq** as a backstop (a `Set<Int>`).
- **Backoff:** exponential 2s→15s + jitter, cap retries (~12, matching the web), then surface
  "disconnected — retry".
- **Approval/background nudges carry `seq = 0`** (live-only, outside the durable seq space) —
  they must **bypass seq dedup**, and the durable truth for approvals is re-fetched from
  `GET /approvals?status=PENDING` on every (re)connect.
- **Lifecycle:** one live `EventStream` per *foreground/active* session. Backgrounded sessions
  rely on the 4s session-list poll + push notifications, not held-open streams. (`URLSession`
  background sessions are for file transfers and don't fit SSE — use a normal session and own
  the lifecycle.)

### 4.2 Transcript reducer (`TranscriptReducer`)

This is the native port of the web `AgentView` event logic — the single most behavior-dense
piece. It folds the `RunEvent` stream into a render model. Rules, by event type:

| Event | Durable? | Reducer action |
|---|---|---|
| `USER` | yes (seq) | append a user bubble; reconcile the optimistic local bubble by `clientTurnId` |
| `ASSISTANT` | yes (seq) | finalize/replace the in-progress assistant bubble with full text |
| `TEXT_DELTA` | no | append to the **streaming buffer** of the current assistant bubble (animation only) |
| `THINKING` / `THINKING_DELTA` | full=yes / delta=no | same pattern for an extended-thinking block |
| `TOOL_USE` | yes (seq) | open a tool-call card keyed by `toolUseId` |
| `TOOL_RESULT` | yes (seq) | attach result to its card by `toolUseId` |
| `TURN_END` | yes (seq) | flush streaming buffers; mark turn done; session → `AWAITING_INPUT` |
| `APPROVAL_REQUEST` | no (seq 0) | add to pending-approvals; raise a notification if unfocused |
| `APPROVAL_RESOLVED` | no (seq 0) | remove from pending-approvals |
| `BACKGROUND_TASK` | yes | background-tray lifecycle (running→done/failed/killed) |
| `BACKGROUND_OUTPUT` | no | live tail into the tray's output buffer |
| `SYSTEM` / `ERROR` / `INTERRUPT` / `RESULT` | yes | lifecycle markers (banner / interrupt delimiter) |

Render model (sketch):

```swift
enum TranscriptItem: Identifiable {
    case user(UserBubble)            // text, attachments, clientTurnId, pending?
    case assistant(AssistantBubble)  // finalized text + live streamingText buffer
    case thinking(ThinkingBlock)
    case toolCall(ToolCard)          // toolUseId, name, input, result?, status
    case interrupt(seq: Int)         // delimits abandoned output
    case error(ErrorBanner)
}
@Observable final class SessionStore {
    var items: [TranscriptItem] = []
    var pendingApprovals: [Approval] = []
    var background: [BackgroundProc] = []
    var status: RunStatus = .pending
    private var seen = Set<Int>()    // seq dedup
    private var maxSeq = 0
    func apply(_ ev: RunEvent) { /* table above; ignore ev.seq>0 already in `seen` */ }
}
```

This class is **fully unit-testable without UI**: feed a recorded SSE transcript (captured
from a real web session), assert the resulting `items`. That test is the Phase-0 gate.

---

## 5. Data model (Swift, mirroring `src/shared`)

Enum string values are stable (the TS file is explicit that values are kept in sync by
string with the Prisma schema), so these port 1:1. Hand-written now; consider codegen later.

```swift
enum RunStatus: String, Codable {
    case pending = "PENDING", running = "RUNNING", succeeded = "SUCCEEDED",
         failed = "FAILED", cancelled = "CANCELLED",
         awaitingInput = "AWAITING_INPUT", interrupted = "INTERRUPTED", parked = "PARKED"
}
enum RunnerStatus: String, Codable { case online = "ONLINE", offline = "OFFLINE", draining = "DRAINING" }
enum PermissionMode: String, Codable, CaseIterable {
    case `default` = "default", acceptEdits = "acceptEdits", plan = "plan",
         auto = "auto", dontAsk = "dontAsk", bypass = "bypassPermissions"
}
enum RunEventType: String, Codable {
    case system, assistant, text_delta, thinking, thinking_delta, tool_use, tool_result,
         status, error, result, user, turn_end, interrupt,
         approval_request, approval_resolved, background_task, background_output
}
enum TaskStatus: String, Codable { case open = "OPEN", inProgress = "IN_PROGRESS", done = "DONE", cancelled = "CANCELLED", failed = "FAILED" }

struct RunEvent: Codable {            // matches NormalizedRunEvent
    let seq: Int
    let type: RunEventType
    let ts: String
    let turnId: String?
    let payload: JSONValue            // type-specific; decode lazily per type
}
struct SessionTurnRequest: Codable {  // POST /sessions/:id/turns
    let clientTurnId: String          // UUID — idempotency
    let content: String
    let kind: String                  // "message" | "shell"
    let attachmentIds: [String]?
}
```

`payload` is heterogeneous; use a small `JSONValue` enum (or decode into per-type structs
keyed off `type`). The default-model list is **not** discoverable from the runner (the
`claude` CLI has no list command), so mirror the web's `lib/agentDefaults` (Opus-first)
statically.

---

## 6. The console surface (native re-implementation of `AgentView`)

- **Transcript:** `TranscriptView` over `SessionStore.items`; markdown via **swift-markdown**
  (or Down) + a syntax highlighter; tool cards render input/result; streaming buffers animate.
- **Composer:** text field + model / permission-mode / effort pickers (from §5 defaults),
  `/` slash menu (from `GET` runner-reported skills, agent-scoped), attachment picker
  (`POST /attachments` → ids → turn). Send posts a turn with a fresh `clientTurnId`;
  optimistic bubble reconciled on the `user` event; **respect 409/429** (queue or disable
  while RUNNING per the queue-while-running rule). Interrupt → `POST /interrupt`.
- **Approvals:** three card kinds — tool-permission (allow/deny + "remember rule"),
  AskUserQuestion (multi-choice form → `answers`), ExitPlanMode (plan markdown + approve).
  Decision → `POST /approvals/:id/decision`. Keyboard parity with web (Enter approves,
  ⌘Enter approve+remember).
- **Worktree bar:** branch + diff summary; **Commit** / **Merge to <target>** (split-button
  with target dropdown); file diff drawer (`GET /sessions/:id/diff`, `…/diff/refresh`);
  conflict → "Resolve in session". Disabled mid-turn.
- **Background tray:** from `background_task`/`background_output`; running spinner →
  done/failed/killed; expandable output tail; completion notification.

---

## 7. Runner Control surface (the native-only payoff)

The app detects whether *this* Mac hosts a runner and, if so, manages it directly — no web
UI can do this.

- **Detect:** read `~/.orbit/config.json` (`{server, runnerId, name, …}`) and
  `$ORBIT_HOME` (default `~/.orbit`).
- **Service status / control:** the launchd label is `com.orbit.runner`, plist at
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.orbit.runner.plist`. Status via
  `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.orbit.runner` (or `launchctl list`); start/stop via
  `launchctl bootstrap|bootout gui/$(id -u) <plist>` (modern) or `launchctl load -w|unload`
  (as the runner installer uses); restart-to-self-update via `launchctl kickstart -k`.
- **Logs:** live-tail `$ORBIT_HOME/runner.log` (`FileHandle` + `DispatchSource` file watch)
  in a console pane.
- **Enroll in-app:** since the app is already authenticated as the user, it can complete the
  runner **device-approval** flow natively — start `orbit register` (or replicate
  `POST /api/runner/device/start`), surface the `userCode`, and call
  `POST /api/runners/device/:userCode/approve` directly. One-app enrollment, no browser
  round-trip.
- **Status & quota:** `GET /runners/:id` for online/slots/`planUsage` (same data the web
  runner page shows), plus the *local* truth (process up? log healthy?) the server can't see.
- **Caveat:** subprocess + file access put this **outside the App Store sandbox** (§9).

---

## 8. Native integrations (why a Mac app beats a tab)

- **MenuBarExtra** (macOS 13+): glanceable count of sessions "needing you", runner
  online/offline dot, quick-new-session, recent sessions. Always present.
- **Notifications** (`UNUserNotificationCenter`): approval needed, turn complete, session
  failed, background task done, runner offline. **Actionable** — Allow/Deny buttons on an
  approval notification POST the decision without opening the app; a Reply action sends a turn.
- **Global hotkey:** a Spotlight-style quick-composer to fire a prompt at an agent from
  anywhere.
- **Dock badge:** count of "needs you".
- **Deep links:** `orbit://session/:id`, `orbit://task/:id`, `orbit://runner/:id` — every
  notification / menu item opens straight to the right view; also enables web→app handoff.
- **Detachable session windows:** open a session in its own window (multi-session monitoring).
- **Keychain:** per-instance `{serverURL, token}`.

---

## 9. Auth, multi-instance, distribution

- **Multi-instance:** self-hosted means the app must accept an instance URL
  (e.g. `https://orbit.wikova.com` or a private one). Store `{serverURL, token, user}` per
  instance in Keychain; allow switching. Login mirrors web: `setup-status` → `/setup` or
  `/login`. On 401 (7-day expiry, no refresh), prompt silent re-login.
- **Distribution: Developer ID + notarization, NOT Mac App Store.** Managing `launchd`,
  spawning `orbit`, and reading `~/.orbit` are incompatible with the MAS sandbox. Ship a
  signed, notarized **universal** (arm64 + x86_64) `.dmg`. Min target **macOS 14** (stable
  `MenuBarExtra`, Observation). Auto-update via **Sparkle** (appcast), hostable on the same
  `/dl` pattern the runner binaries already use. CI does sign + notarize + staple.

---

## 10. Risks & honest tradeoffs

1. **Console rebuild cost (biggest).** ~2,500 lines of `AgentView` behavior + ~4,500 lines
   CSS, re-expressed in SwiftUI, then maintained at parity with the web **forever**.
   *Mitigation:* `OrbitKit` isolates all protocol logic (only views duplicate); **deep-link
   long-tail surfaces** (Skills, Admin, Settings detail, cost dashboard) into the web instead
   of rebuilding them; gate native features behind flags so web can stay ahead.
2. **Parity drift.** Every new web feature needs a Swift twin. *Mitigation:* a shared
   events/DTO contract (§5) as the single source of truth; codegen Swift models from
   `src/shared` if it grows.
3. **SSE/seq correctness.** Native reconnect + dedup must be airtight. *Mitigation:* the
   Phase-0 reducer is unit-tested against recorded transcripts before any UI exists.
4. **Markdown + highlighting + diffs** are non-trivial natively (web gets react-markdown +
   highlight.js for free). Budget real time for `TranscriptView`.
5. **Sandbox vs runner-control** forces Developer-ID (not MAS) distribution — accepted.
6. **Consider the cheaper alternative honestly:** a thin **menu-bar-only** companion (runner
   control + notifications + deep-link to web for the console) delivers ~70% of the daily
   value for ~20% of the effort. If timeline matters more than a fully native console, ship
   that first and grow into the full console — this design's layering makes that path
   incremental, not a throwaway.

---

## 11. Phasing (de-risk hardest-first; each phase has a verify gate)

| Phase | Deliverable | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| **0 · OrbitKit core** | `APIClient` + `Models` + `Keychain` + `EventStream` (SSE) + `TranscriptReducer`, no UI | unit test: feed a recorded SSE transcript, assert `items`/approvals/background match the web render |
| **1 · Read-only console** | login + instance picker, sidebar (Active), open a session, **live transcript** (deltas, tool cards, thinking) | a live session mirrors the web side-by-side |
| **2 · Interactive console** | composer (text/model/permission/effort/slash/attachments), send+queue+interrupt, **3 approval kinds**, worktree bar, background tray | drive a full session natively to parity |
| **3 · Native shell** | MenuBarExtra, actionable notifications, Dock badge, global hotkey, deep links, detachable windows | fire a task, close the window, get pinged to approve from the notification |
| **4 · Runner control** | detect/enroll local runner, `launchctl` start/stop, live log tail, status+quota | install a runner from the app; start/stop reflected in `launchctl list` |
| **5 · Tasks + ship** | task list/detail/create/execute, comments, deps; dark-mode parity; **sign + notarize + Sparkle + DMG** | notarized DMG installs + auto-updates on a clean Mac |

A pragmatic **MVP** is Phases 0–1 + the menu bar from 3 + runner control from 4 (the
native-only value), with the console's send path (Phase 2) and tasks (Phase 5) following.
```
